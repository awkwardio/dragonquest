# Dragon Quest

Dragon Quest is a text-based Python game. You're a brave knight on a mission to defeat a goblin, a troll, and a mighty dragon. Guess each creature's location by picking a number. If your number matches a random integer, each creature will take a hit! If not, they'll hit you. Defeat all three creatures to win. If they take all of your HP, you lose. Good luck!
